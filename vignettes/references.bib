While first-generation methods used precomputed expression signatures covering limited cell types and tissues, second-generation tools use single-cell RNA sequencing data to build custom signatures for deconvoluting arbitrary cell types, tissues, and organisms. This flexibility poses significant challenges in assessing their deconvolution performance. Here, we comprehensively benchmark second-generation tools, disentangling different sources of variation and bias using a diverse panel of real and simulated data. Our study highlights the strengths, limitations, and complementarity of state-of-the-art tools shedding light on how different data characteristics and confounders impact deconvolution performance.

Analysis of common cell types between tissues, such as blood and muscle cells, reveals rare cell types and tissue-specific subtypes.

Unlike their human equivalents, methods to quantify the cellular composition of complex tissues from murine transcriptomics are sparse and sometimes not easy to use. We extended the immunedeconv R package to facilitate the deconvolution of mouse transcriptomics, enabling the quantification of murine immune-cell types using 13 different methods. Through immunedeconv, we further offer the possibility of tweaking cell signatures used by deconvolution methods, providing custom annotations tailored for specific cell types and tissues. These developments strongly facilitate the study of the immune-cell composition of mouse models and further open new avenues in the investigation of the cellular composition of other tissues and organisms.The R package and the documentation are available at https://github.com/omnideconv/immunedeconv.},

While first-generation deconvolution methods rely on precomputed, transcriptional signatures of a handful of cell types, second-generation methods can be trained with single-cell data to disentangle more fine-grained cell phenotypes and states. These novel approaches can also be applied to spatial transcriptomic data to reveal the spatial organization of tumors. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art deconvolution methods (first-generation, second-generation, and spatial) which can be used to investigate the tumor microenvironment, discussing their strengths and limitations. We conclude with an outlook on the challenges that need to be overcome to unlock the full potential of next-generation deconvolution for oncology and the life sciences.},

We have generated more than 700 data sets and discovered protein-coding, noncoding, RNA regulatory, replication, and chromatin elements, more than tripling the annotated portion of the Drosophila genome. Correlated activity patterns of these elements reveal a functional regulatory network, which predicts putative new functions for genes, reveals stage- and tissue-specific regulators, and enables gene-expression prediction.

  abstract = {Aging is commonly described as being a continuous process affecting progressively organisms as time passes. This process results in a progressive decrease in individuals fitness through a wide range of both organismal–decreased motor activity, fertility, resistance to stress–and molecular phenotypes–decreased protein and energy homeostasis, impairment of insulin signaling. In the past 20 years, numerous genes have been identified as playing a major role in the aging process, yet little is known about the events leading to that loss of fitness. We recently described an event characterized by a dramatic increase of intestinal permeability to a blue food dye in aging flies committed to die within a few days. Importantly, flies showing this so called ‘Smurf’ phenotype are the only ones, among a population, to show various age-related changes and exhibit a high-risk of impending death whatever their chronological age. Thus, these observations suggest that instead of being one continuous phenomenon, aging may be a discontinuous process well described by at least two distinguishable phases. In this paper we addressed this hypothesis by implementing a new 2 Phases of Aging mathematiCal model (2PAC model) to simulate longevity curves based on the simple hypothesis of two consecutive phases of lifetime presenting different properties. We first present a unique equation for each phase and discuss the biological significance of the 3 associated parameters. Then we evaluate the influence of each parameter on the shape of survival curves. Overall, this new mathematical model, based on simple biological observations, is able to reproduce many experimental longevity curves, supporting the existence of 2 phases of aging exhibiting specific properties and separated by a dramatic transition that remains to be characterized. Moreover, it indicates that Smurf survival can be approximated by one single constant parameter for a broad range of genotypes that we have tested under our environmental conditions.},

By contrast, the ‘Smurf’ assay separates high-and-constant-mortality risk individuals from healthy, zero-mortality risk individuals, based on increased intestinal permeability. Performing whole body total RNA sequencing, we found that Smurfness distinguishes transcriptional changes associated with chronological age from those associated with biological age. We show that transcriptional heterogeneity increases with chronological age in non-Smurf individuals preceding the other five hallmarks of ageing that are specifically associated with the Smurf state. Using this approach, we also devise targeted pro-longevity genetic interventions delaying entry in the Smurf state. We anticipate that increased attention to the evolutionary conserved Smurf phenotype will bring about significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of ageing.},
